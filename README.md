This repository is for an assignment for a computational linguistics course.

In this code, I made a model that predict RGB value from Japanese traditional color names (珊瑚色, 露草色, etc.).

# Dataset
I collected Japanese color names from the following sites and created my own dataset. (https://www.colordic.org/w) Please see dataset.csv.

# When you train the model
```$ python train.py```

# When you test the model
See the jupyter code (```$ test.ipynb```).
